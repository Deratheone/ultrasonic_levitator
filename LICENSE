## Educational Use Notice

This project is designed for educational and demonstration purposes. When using 
this project for academic or research purposes, please provide appropriate 
attribution to the original work and consider citing the project if used in 
academic publications.

## Safety Disclaimer

Users are responsible for ensuring safe operation of the ultrasonic levitation 
system. While the 40kHz frequency used is generally considered safe, prolonged 
exposure to high-intensity ultrasonic waves should be avoided. Always follow 
proper safety protocols when working with electronic circuits and high-frequency 
acoustic devices.

## Competition Use

This project has been successfully demonstrated in science exhibitions and 
competitions. Users are welcome to build upon this design for their own 
competitive entries, but should properly acknowledge the original work and 
contribute their own innovations and improvements.
